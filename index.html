## About me

Hello everyone! I am a first year PhD student in the department of Biostatistics at JHSPH. My research interests are not concrete as I still would like to explore the many different areas I haven't come in contact with yet, but I do enjoy SLAM. I was born and raise in New Hampshire and moved to Maine before high school. I attended Cornell University where I majored in statistics and  minored in French. I enjoy reading, watching shows/movies, baking, and doing pottery. I am also a huge animal lover.

## Statistics

I majored in statistics so I have some experience with R, SAS and Stata. The majority of my statistics, programming, and data analysis experience comes from college. I have never used Github before. I am hoping this course will expand and solidify my knowledge of R. 

## Five Fun Facts

1. I have dual citizenship with Spain and the US
2. I enjoy eating food from all over the world
3. I get very competititve with board and video games
4. I have seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy more times than I would like to admit 
5. I can be very indecisive

I like [this website](https://www.mdspca.org) because it has many adoptable pets that need a home. Please consider adopting, fostering, volunteering or organizing a fundraiser for your local SPCA.
